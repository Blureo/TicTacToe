# TicTacToe

This is a simple, command-line based version of the game *Tic-Tac-Toe*

If you have issues compiling this in VS-Code, the issue may be that you have to edit the tasks.json file to ensure the code is compiling with both main.cpp and functions.h/functions.cpp.

In the future I want to make this an GUI-based application
